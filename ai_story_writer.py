        Writing Guidelines:
        Delve deeper. Lose yourself in the world you're building. Unleash vivid
        descriptions to paint the scenes in your reader's mind.
        Develop your characters ‚Äî let their motivations, fears, and complexities unfold naturally.
        Weave in the threads of your outline, but don't feel constrained by it.
        Allow your story to surprise you as you write. Use rich imagery, sensory details, and
        evocative language to bring the setting, characters, and events to life.
        Introduce elements subtly that can blossom into complex subplots, relationships,
        or worldbuilding details later in the story.
        Keep things intriguing but not fully resolved.
        Avoid boxing the story into a corner too early.
        Plant the seeds of subplots or potential character arc shifts that can be expanded later.
        Remember, your main goal is to write as much as you can. If you get through
        the story too fast, that is bad. Expand, never summarize.
        Aim for a story of at least {target_words} words (about {page_length} pages).'''

        First, silently review the outline and the premise. Consider how to start the
        story.

        Start to write the very beginning of the story. You are not expected to finish
        the whole story now. Your writing should be detailed enough that you are only
        scratching the surface of the first bullet of your outline. Try to write AT MINIMUM {initial_words} WORDS.

        First, silently review the outline and story so far. Identify what the single

        Your task is to continue where you left off and write the next part of the story.

        detailed enough that you are only scratching the surface of the next part of
        your outline. Try to write AT MINIMUM 1000 WORDS. However, only once the story
        is COMPLETELY finished, write IAMDONE. Remember, do NOT write a whole chapter
        right now.
